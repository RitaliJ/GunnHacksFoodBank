# GunnHacksFoodBank
Food Bank Project for Gunn Hacks 8.0

This project serves as a CA Food Bank Locator. The user inputs their zip code and finds the 9 food banks located closest to them. There is also a discord bot that provides the user information on food banks in their county.

# APIS
Our project utilizes the Alpha.CA.gov Food Bank API to locate food banks based on location coordinates. It also uses the Geocode.xyz Forward Geocoding API to convert the user's zip codes into coordinates that can be used to access the Food Bank API.
